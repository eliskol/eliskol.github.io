My primary mathematical interests lie in algebra.
I'm currently doing a [DRP](https://www.ucsbdrp.org/) project with [Jitendra Rathore](https://sites.google.com/view/jitendra-rathore/) on algebraic geometry.
I'm reading from [Algebraic Geometry I](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-658-30733-2) by Gortz & Wedhorn.

I am also interested in probability and am currently taking a [Math for Data Science & Machine Learning](https://web.atzberger.org/pmwiki_intranet/index.php?n=Teaching2026WinterCS120ML.Homepage?setskin=atzbergerClassSkin2) course in the College of Creative Studies.
